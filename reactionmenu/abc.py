                            Added try/except/finally for handling of :param:`delete_menu_message` and :param:`clear_reactions`. If any exception was to occur during the message deletion or reaction removal
                            process, the most important thing is to still cancel the session [finally]. 

                            Before, the call to [session_task.cancel()] was the first execution in this method; and in <= v1.0.8, that was okay because a call to this method would only happen externally. Meaning only the user
                            could call this method. Now in v1.0.9, this method can be called internally. The main internal call is from the [asyncio.TimeoutError] section in :meth:`_execute_session`. Now that
                            this method is called from :meth:`_execute_session`, that means this method is now being kept alive by the main session task. Before, [asyncio.TimeoutError] would do its own thing, that thing being
                            handling the removal of reactions/deleting the menu message from a *seperate task*.
                            
                            Now in v1.0.9, this method is apart of the [asyncio.TimeoutError] process, so if I call [session_task.cancel()] first, this method could be cancelled because it was called from a method (:meth:`_execute_session`)
                            who's life cycle is dependant on the session task (see below for a more clear explanation). The main thing that needs to occur when this method is called from :meth:`_execute_session` ([asyncio.TimeoutError])
                            is that ALL expectations are fulfilled. Those expectations are deleting the menu message or removing the reactions and more importantly, stopping the [session task]. Since stopping the [session task] is the most important,
                            it is placed in the [finally] of this method. So no matter what happens, even if deleting the message or removing the reactions failed, stopping the [session task] will always be completed

                            It is to be noted the [session_task.cancel()] is now the last thing to be executed because of a race condition. If I was to put it as the first thing, it is possible for the main session task callback to be completed
                            first, and if that happens the rest of the code will not execute. From what i've tested, I technically could put it there (at the top) because the call to class :meth:`_remove_session` and setting :attr:`_is_running` to `False`
                            happens much faster than the main session task callback takes to fully execute. But to be on the safe side, just put it at the end.
